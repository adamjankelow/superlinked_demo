# Semantic Food Search Demo

A demo semantic search engine for food items built with Superlinked and Streamlit. This demo showcases advanced search capabilities including semantic similarity, multi-criteria weighted search, and numeric range filtering.

## Features

### Simple Semantic Search
- Natural language search for food items based on descriptions
- Returns semantically similar results based off text


### Multi-Criteria Weighted Search  
- Combine text descriptions and food categories
- Adjust weights to fine-tune search relevance
- Interactive visualization of search results using UMAP
- See how different weights affect the results in real-time

### Numeric Range Search
- Filter by nutritional values like calories
- Combine numeric and semantic criteria
- Visual analysis of results with interactive charts
- Calculate statistics across search results

### Combined Search
- Unified interface for all search modes
- Hard filtering by food categories
- Flexible combination of search criteria
- Optimized for intuitive exploration


## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:adamjankelow/superlinked_demo.git
   cd superlinked_demo
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   - Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment (on Linux):
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   - From the root of the project directory, execute:
     ```bash
     streamlit run src/frontend/main.py
     ```


## Code Structure

### `src/frontend/main.py`
This module serves as the main **Streamlit application UI**. It manages user interactions, renders forms, and displays search results along with UMAP visualizations. To launch the app, use the command:

### `src/backend/queries.py`  
Core search logic using Superlinked.

### `src/backend/types.py`  
Data classes for shared context and parameters.

### `src/backend/utils/data.py`  
Utility functions for loading data and building the Superlinked app/index.

### `src/backend/utils/umap.py`  
Helpers for UMAP projection and visualization; loads or caches `data/umap_df.parquet`.

### `scripts/build_umap.py`  
CLI script to generate and cache UMAP vectors for all embeddings, writing to `data/umap_df.parquet`.

### `data/`  
Directory for raw and derived data files (e.g., `sampled_food_db.parquet`, `umap_df.parquet`).

### `notebooks/`  
Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and prototyping (e.g., multi-language search demo).
